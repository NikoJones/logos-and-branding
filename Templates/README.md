# Templates

## PowerPoint
This directory contains PowerPoint templates to be used in all CSS workshops and events.  
There are two Powerpoint files to note:
1. "CSS Presentation Template.pptx"
    - This is just a slide deck that contains the CSS template slides
2. "CSS Presentation Template.potx"
    - This is a PowerPoint template file which, when opened, creates a new presentation for you with the template applied  

To use the template on Google Slides, simply upload either file to Google Drive, right click, and select "Open With Slides". Minor adjustments may need to be made to textboxes in Google Slides to make everything fit as desired.  

## Word
There are also Word templates for any CSS documents:
1. "CSS Document Template With Filler.docx"
    - This contains the full template with filler text and graphics
2. "CSS Document Template Title Pages.docx"
    - This contains only the template title pages
